Sry for a mess layout of my file cause I am now not familiar with Github file operation.


I recommend html format file in the branch to view the result.  

I will upload trading strategy including high frequency trading, algorithmic trading, statistical arbitrage, correlation trading, and volatility trading in the next few weeks

- For statistical arbitrage trading, I only finished pair trading. 
  Here are two versions of pair trading. The version 2 is more concise, more readable. The both has different objectives. I strongly         recommend reading both of them if you have interest.
