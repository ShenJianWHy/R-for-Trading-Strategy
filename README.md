I will upload trading strategy including high frequency trading, algorithmic trading, statistical arbitrage, correlation trading, and volatility trading in the next few weeks

-For statistical arbitrage trading, I only finished pair trading. Please see the "statistical arbitrage" branch
  Here are two versions of pair trading. The version 2 is more concise, more readable. The both has different objectives. I strongly         recommend reading both of them if you have interest.
